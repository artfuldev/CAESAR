*Chess Analysis Engine as an exercise in Software Architecture and Review (CAESAR)*

A pet project that aims to build a chess engine with a focus on software architecture and best
practices.


##The What
A chess engine is a computer program that analyses chess positions and makes decisions on the
best chess moves. We will be constructing a chess engine in C#. Our focus will be on problems
related to the software architecture and design principles, such as SOLID principles and
general coding best practices, actually adhereing to these, while building an engine that plays
chess really well.

In addition to the source code, we'll also produce a set of written articles covering the general
concepts and patterns, the rationale behind design choices, and a few other things to help
everyone.

I intend this to be an interactive act of discovery.

So, we're attempting to create a chess engine with software best practices in mind - simple, no?

##The Why
Chess engines are almost always written way too optimized for "anyone" to just "have a peek under
the hood" and dive in with contributions. Since it's a highly competitive area, the source code
of most highly rated chess engines are close to unreadable without comments or prior knowledge.
I have come across beautiful tutorials with general guidelines and also step-by-step instructions
on how to create a chess engine from scratch. But none of them hold on to software architecture
design patterns or plain simple coding best practices. Also, a chess engine is a fairly
challenging piece of software to write, as it invariably will need a lot of tuning and testing
and generally has a really long software lifecycle (meaning we can keep updating it for years
together and there will still be value to add).

TLDR: A chess engine is complicated, fun to code, and can serve as an example of software
development in every possible area.

My approach is to embark on a collaborative journey into understanding the mechanics and
challenges surrounding the development of a chess engine, which is also a structurally,
functionally and architecturally sound piece of software. My purpose is not to tell you all
the answers that you'll need, but rather to help you ask the right questions.

##The How
The goal is to create a cross-platform console application that runs on DNX. Naturally we will
be breaking down the functionality into libraries (that are also cross-platform).

More granular details on what we will accomplishing on a time-frame basis will be updated in
the journal localted in the docs folder of the repository.

I am very interested in your feedback. I encourage you to open issues on this repo. Any and all
feedback is welcome.

##The Who
The intended audience for this guidance/project is any developer, senior developer or architect
interested in developing a software solution which focuses on best practices. I hope that all
developers, regardless of their preferred development stack, can benefit from the written
guidance.

If you feel that there is anything more that we can do to make this accessible to a broader
audience, you are encouraged to share.

##Next Steps
* Go to the [docs](docs) folder, review the content, review the source code, and just dive in!

##Problems, Concerns, and Feedback
You can communicate via email to kenshin@thebattosai.in or even open issues at this repo, if
something doesn't make sense or we have other troubles to be looked into.
