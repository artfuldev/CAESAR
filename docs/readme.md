# Navigating the Docs

_If you want to understand the intent of this project as well as some of the basic terms we'll
be using, be sure to read the [readme file](../README.md) in the root of the repo._

The documentation for this project is organized as follows:

1. The primary content is in this folder. The files are listed in a suggested reading order,
but many of them can be read in isolation.
2. The folder `pending` contains documents that we are revising.
3. The folder `media` contains any media that is used in the documentation.
