# Fixing The Board

In our [last journal entry](05%20-%20A%20%SOLID%20Look%20At%20The%20Board.md), we found that we had
problems with our implementation, with respect to how we wanted our project to move forward. Now it's
time to fix them.

Our first step is to raise the issues to keep track of:

* [Square doesn't follow Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/kenshinthebattosai/CAESAR/issues/6)
* [File doesn't follow Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/kenshinthebattosai/CAESAR/issues/7)
* [Rank doesn't follow Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/kenshinthebattosai/CAESAR/issues/8)
* [It isn't apparent how many squares, ranks and files a Board has](https://github.com/kenshinthebattosai/CAESAR/issues/9)

This allows us to follow them at long last, and to keep the docs concise. We will be addressing the
concerns in the issues themselves. Follow the issues until our next journal entry.
