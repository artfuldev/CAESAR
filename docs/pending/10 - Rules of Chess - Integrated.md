# Rules of Chess - Integrated

In this journal entry, we will take a look at how we integrated The Rules of Chess as disscussed in
[Journal Entry 09](../09%20-%20The%20Rules%20Of%20Chess.md), the challenges we faced, and the
reasoning behind our design choices and implementations.

If you're interested in a quick skip, after adding code, we reviewed the code additions via a
[review issue](https://github.com/kenshinthebattosai/CAESAR/issues/64). Otherwise, follow on.
