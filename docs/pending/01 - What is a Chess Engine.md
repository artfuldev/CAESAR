#What is a Chess Engine?
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_engine), *a chess engine is a
computer program that analyses chess positions and makes decisions on the best chess moves*.
That can be a broad requirement to a software developer without any specifics. So, as any good
software developer should, let us try to make the requirements more concrete, since it is our
requirement to construct one.

Obviously we should learn a bit about chess. I'd suggest reading [the associated Wikipedia
article on chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess), but if you wish, you can skip that,
as we will be detailing/examining the requirements as we go, at each and every step.

From what we can all gather at this point, with just the first line of the Wikipedia statement,
and with no prior knowledge whatsoever of chess, a keen reader and developer could have
arrived at the following conclusions:

A chess engine can:
 
1. Recognize chess positions
2. Recognize chess moves
3. Generate possible chess moves (at a particular chess position?)
4. Evaluate chess moves (arising from a particular chess position?)
5. Make decisions on the best chess moves based on this evaluation
